# Remote controller

## what is this?
&nbsp;This should be a server-client, where one has the game running, gets frames and send to another, then it will process and train a model and send the action to the one running the game.

## why?
&nbsp;Because i have a very slow PC, and a fast one. But I want to use my pc while it trains, but because the model gets frames from the game, i cannot minimize the program. There should be a easier way to do this, but i find this idea really cool.
