## About the model

### Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are a class of deep reinforcement learning algorithms introduced by Mnih et al. in 2015. They combine deep neural networks with Q-learning, enabling agents to learn directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs, such as raw pixel data, to achieve human-level control in various tasks, including playing Atari games.
